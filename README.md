# CLUSTERING- UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
This project is done by using the dataset Iris from sklearn. This is a unsupervised ml using clustering algorthim:
1.KMeans Clustering
2.Hierarchical Clustering

# Importing the needed library,modules and functions for our project:
1. pandas
2. seaborn
3. matplotlib
4. sklearn
5. scipy
6. standardscaler
7. KMeans
8. AgglomerativeClustering
9. Silhouette Score
10. dendrogram
Load the dataset and clean the data set by using isnull to know the null values and duplicate function used for find out duplicate values and took the info to know the overall about the dataset.
By using describe function we took the statistical values to find the mean median.
Scatterplot is used to find the pattern of data distributed and after that the data is standardised by usig srandardscaler.
Kmean clustering is used by taking n_clusters from the data and find the clusters.
Hierarchical clustering done by taking 2 as a n_clusters and plot a scatter plot. we get better  Silhouette Score by taking 2 as n_clusters.
By plotting dentrogram we find the relationship of the data.
